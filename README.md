# Constructors

JS has a number of built-in object types, such as:

- Math 
- Date
- Object
- Function
- Boolean
- Symbol
- Array
- Map
- Set
- Promise
- JSON etc.

These objects are sometimes referred to as "native objects".

COnstructor functions, commonly referred to as just "constructors", are special functions that allow us to build instances of these built-in native objects. All the constructors are capitalized.

To use a constructor function, I must prepend it with the operator new.

For example, to create a new instance of the Date object, I can run: new Date (). What I get back is the current datetime, such as:

Sat Aug 05 2023 14:04:23 GMT+0300 (East African Time)

However, not all the built-in objects come with a constructor function. An example of such an object type is the built-in Math object.

Running new Math() throws an Uncaught TypeError, informing us that Math is not a constructor.

It can be concluded that some built-in objects do have constructors, when they serve a particular purpose: to allow us to instantiate a specific instance of a given object's constructor. The built-in Date object is perfectly suited for having a constructor because each new date object instance built should have unique data by definition, since it's going to be a different timestamp - it's going to be built at a different moment in time.

Other built-in objects that don't have constructors, such as the Math object, don't need a constructor. They're just static objects whose properties and methods can be accessed directly, from the built-in object itself. In other words, there is no point in building an instance of the built-in Math object to be able to use its functionality.

For example, if you want to use the pow method of the Math object to calculate exponential values, there's no need to build an instance of the Math object to do so. For example, to get the number 2 to the power 5, you'd run:

```
Math.pow(2, 5); // --> 32
```

There's no need to build an instance of the Math object since there would be nothing that needs to be stored in that specific object's instance.

Besides constructor functions for the built-in objects, I can also define custom constructor functions.

Example:

```
function Icecream(flavor) {
    this.flavor = flavor;
    this.meltIt = function() {
        console.log(`The ${this.flavor} icecream has melted`)
    }
}
```

Now, you can make as many icecreams as you want:

```
function Icecream(flavor) {
    this.flavor = flavor;
    this.meltIt = function() {
        console.log(`This ${this.flavor} icecream has melted`)
    }
}

let kiwiIcecream = new Icecream("kiwi");
let appleIcecream = new Icecream("apple");
kiwiIcecream; // --> Icecream {flavor: 'kiwi', meltIt: f}
appleIcecream; // --> Icecream {flavor: 'apple', meltIt: f}
```

The snippet above builds two instance objects of Icecream type.

The most common use case of new is to use it with one of the built-in object types.

Note that using constructor functions on all built-in objects is sometimes not the best approach.

This is especially true for object constructors of primitive types, namely: String, Number and Boolean.

For example, using the built-in String constructor, you can build new strings:

```
let apple = new String("apple);
apple; // --> String{'apple'}
```

The apple variable is an object of type String.

Let's see how the apple object differs from the following pear variable:

```
let pear = "pear";
pear; // --> "pear"
```

The pear variable is a string literal, that is, a primitive Javascript value.

The pear variable, being a primitive value, will always be more performant than the apple variable, which is an object.

Besides being more performant, due to the fact that each object in JavaScript is unique, you can't compare a String object with another String object, even when their values are identical.

In other words, if you compare new String('plum') === new String('plum'), you'll get back false, while "plum" === "plum" returns true. You're getting the false when comparing objects because it is not the values that you pass to the constructor that are being compared, but rather the memory location where objects are saved.

Besides not using constructors to build object versions of primitives, you are better off not using constructors when constructing plain, regular objects.

Instead of new Object, you should stick to the object literal syntax: {}.

A RegExp object is another built-in object in JavaScript. It's used to pattern-match strings using what's known as "Regular Expressions". Regular Expressions exist in many languages, not just JavaScript.

In JavaScript, you can built an instance of the RegExp constructor using new RegExp. 

Alternatively, you can use a pattern literal instead of RegExp. Here's an example of using /d/ as a pattern literal, passed-in as an argument to the match method on a string.

```
"abcd".match(/d/); // null
"abcd".match(/a/); // ['a', index: 0, input: 'abcd', groups: undefined]
```

Instead of using Array, Function, and RegExp constructors, you should use their array literal, function literal, and pattern literal varieties: [], () {}, and /()/.

However, when building objects of other built-in types, we can use the constructor.

Here are a few examples:

```
new Date();
new Error();
new Map();
new Promise();
new Set();
new WeakSet();
new WeakMap();
```
